user_description: Hello, My name is Jose Melendez. I am currently working as a photographer looking for a full-time positions as an iOS developer. I have been developing iOS apps for a little over a yea. I currently have two apps on the App Store with more on the way. I first began developing iOS apps on my own, but quickly realize it was going to be tough. So I decided to attend a coding bootcamp in Salt Lake City, Utah, called DevMountain. It was a 12 week fully immersive program, where I gained a broad understanding of what you need to do in order to build an iOS app.
