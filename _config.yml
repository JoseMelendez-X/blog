user_description: Hello, My name is Jose Melendez. I am currently working as a photographer and looking for a full-time position as an iOS developer. I have been developing iOS apps for a little over a year. I currently have two apps on the App Store with more on the way. I first began developing iOS apps on my own, but quickly realize it was going to be tough. So I decided to attend a coding bootcamp in Salt Lake City, Utah, called DevMountain. It was a 12 week fully immersive program, where I gained the necessary knowledge to build iOS apps. I continued my learning after the bootcamp, by watching  Stanford University’s “Developing iOS Apps with Swift” course. This course really reinforced my knowledge of Swift and also introduced me to many new concepts and ways of building iOS apps. With my little but sufficient knowledge and continued passion for learning more, I believe I would be a great asset to any team.
